# wordle-solver
A collection of various Wordle solvers built in Python, with one random guesser, one based on word frequency, and one based on entropy and information gain optimisation. The collection of possible word guesses is taken from the [Wordle website](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

All files included were created externally, and then uploaded to GitHub at a later date.
